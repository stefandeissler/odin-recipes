      <h2>Description</h2>
      <p>
        This is a meat-free version of the classic British dish. The pie consists of two layers: a vegetable ragout as base, topped with mashed potatoes. 
        Once assembled, it is covered with grated cheese and baked in the oven.

      <h2>Steps</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Heat up the oven at 180&deg;C. Put the potatoes in a pot with salted water and bring to the boil. Simmer for about 12 minutes 
          or until the potatoes are done, but not falling apart. Take off the hub and drain. Mash the drained potatoes and mix with 
          salt, pepper, and some butter.
        </li>
        <li>
          In a frying pan, heat two tablespoons of olive oil. Add the crushed chillies and fry for about 3 minutes on a medium-high heat. 
          Then, add the diced onion and carrot and fry for another ten minutes until soft. Add the red pepper and the brown mushrooms, 
          keep on the heat for another five minutes, stirring from time to time.
        </li>
        <li>
          Season the vegetables with salt, pepper, smoked paprika and a tea spoon of mustard. Then, add the tinned tomatoes and simmer until 
          you get a thick ragout-like sauce. Take off the heat and let cool slightly before stirring in the yeast flakes.
        </li>
        <li>
          Put the vegetable ragout in an oven dish and spread evenly. Top with the potato mash and plenty of grated cheese. Bake in the oven 
          for about 15-20 minutes, until the cheese is golden brown.
        </li>
