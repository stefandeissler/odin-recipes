    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      This traditional Spanish dish consists of potatoes that have been cut into 2cm cubes and then are fried in olive oil. 
      It is named after the spicy tomato sauce it is served with (hence the term <i>bravas</i> - brave).
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Olive oil</li>
      <li>Potatoes, peeled and chopped into to 2cm cubes</li>
      <li>Fresh red chillies, finely chopped</li>
      <li>Garlic cloves, peeled and finely chopped</li>
      <li>Tin of chopped tomatoes</li>
      <li>Salt and pepper</li>
      <li>Chopped parsley</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Heat the olive oil in a large frying pan. Put the potatoes in the pan and make sure they are completely covered in oil.
        Season with salt and pepper and fry for about 10 minutes, until starting to turn brown.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add the garlic and the chillies, fry everything for a minute. Then add the tomatoes. Simmer for about 20 minutes, stirring frequently. 
      </li>
      <li>
        Once the potatoes are ready, and the sauce is flavoursome and thick, turn off the heat. Put on a serving dish and 
        sprinkle with the parsley.

    </ol>
